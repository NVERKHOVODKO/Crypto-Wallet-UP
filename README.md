Description of the .NET Application Example project
Introduction
The .NET Application Example project is an example of a web application developed on the .NET platform using modern technologies and tools. This project serves as a demonstration of best practices in developing web applications on the .NET platform and includes a number of key components and technologies.

Technologies and tools
The .NET Application Example project uses the following technologies and tools:

C#: The C# programming language is used to develop the application and its business logic.

ASP.NET Core: The ASP.NET Core web framework enables the creation of web applications with high performance and scalability.

Entity Framework Core: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Entity Framework Core allows you to conveniently interact with a PostgreSQL database, providing object-oriented access to data.

Swagger: The Swagger tool is used to automatically generate interactive API documentation, making it easier to develop, test, and document APIs.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL relational database is used to store application data.

AutoMapper: AutoMapper makes it easy to map data between objects, which improves performance and reduces the amount of code you write.

Main components of the project
The .NET Application Example project includes the following key components:

API Controllers: ASP.NET Core API controllers process incoming HTTP requests, interacting with clients and providing access to application data.

PostgreSQL Database: This project uses PostgreSQL to store data. Entity Framework Core provides easy interaction with the database.

Models: Data models define the structure and schema of the data that is stored in the database.

Swagger UI: Interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. It allows developers and testers to easily explore and test APIs.

Dependency Injection (DI): The project uses Dependency Injection (DI) to manage dependencies and provide flexibility to the application. DI allows you to inject dependencies such as services and repositories into controllers and other components.

Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection (DI) is a popular design pattern that is used in the .NET Application Example project. DI allows you to manage application component dependencies and provides a more flexible and testable design.

The benefits of Dependency Injection in a project include:

Separation of Responsibility: DI allows you to separate the creation of objects and their use. This improves readability and ensures compliance with single responsibility principles.

Testability: Thanks to DI, application components can be easily replaced with mocks or mocks when writing unit tests.

Reduced coupling: DI reduces coupling between components, making code more flexible and maintainable.

Ease of Dependency Injection: Dependency injection makes code more explicit and understandable, making it easier to maintain.
